## RobotVoice
Nothing more than a view that looks like a robot's voice, created with Swift.

### Description
I needed a voice visualizer for a robot costume.  That's really all there is to it.  Sorry to any and all robots I've offended in the process of making assumptions about how your voice looks.

### Requirements
Xcode 7 should cover it.

### Usage
You speak, it visualizes.
